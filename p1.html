AI is not a new technology. For decades computer scientists have tried different approaches to reach the holy grail of computing: intelligent machines. While we are still far away from replicating the wonders of the human brain, AI applications have started to fill our daily lives and power our electronic devices, from smartphones to home alarm systems.

Why this seemingly sudden explosion? teaching you what modern AI is, what are the core principles behind it, and how and why we got where we are now.

1.1   The path to modern AI
As humans, we’ve always tried to find ways to understand the world around us and bend Nature to meet our goals. To do so, we have always relied on external tools that amplify our brain’s capabilities.

The Abacus was probably the first such tool, invented about 5000-6000 years ago to help people make calculations. While it‘s still used in schools to help children visualize simple mathematical operations, it doesn’t really save us from the labor of actually performing the calculations. We have to wait until the 1960s for the first machines that can add and subtract numbers automatically. Computers have gone a long way since then, but deep down their capability has still been pretty simple: executing calculations exactly as some (expert) human has instructed them to do. There’s little “intelligence” in them.

The two words “Artificial” and “Intelligence” were first put together the 31st of August 1955, when prof. John McCarty from the University of Dartmouth, together with M.L Minsky, N. Rochester and C. E. Shannon, asked the Rockefeller foundation to fund a summer of research on Artificial Intelligence. The proposal stated:

We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. [...] An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.
